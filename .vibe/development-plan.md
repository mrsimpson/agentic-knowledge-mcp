## Key Decisions
- **Paradigm Shift**: Moving from traditional RAG (chunking + embeddings + reranking) to agentic search patterns
- **Context Revolution**: Leveraging 200K+ token context windows instead of working around context limitations
- **Direct Navigation**: Using filesystem-like tools (grep, glob, direct file access) instead of similarity search
- **Investigation over Retrieval**: Agents that follow references and build understanding incrementally
- **Guidance over Tools**: Following responsible-vibe pattern - provide dynamic instructions rather than fixed tools
- **Tool Evolution Compatibility**: Instructions remain stable as agent capabilities evolve (grep → AST parsing → future tools)
- **Interface Design**: search_docs() + list_docsets() as core tools
- **No LLM Integration**: System remains AI-free for reliability and speed
- **Single Docset Constraint**: One docset per query for simplicity
- **Agent-Driven Processing**: All language understanding delegated to calling agent
- **Configuration Strategy**: .knowledge folder pattern, no global fallbacks
- **Package Structure**: Clean monorepo with core logic separated from protocol
- **local_path Terminology**: Consistent naming throughout system
- **Template-Based Instructions**: Simple variable substitution for flexible guidance
- **TypeScript Monorepo**: Using proven template for consistency and maintainability

## Notes

### Implementation Milestones Summary:
1. **Foundation** (1-2 days): Monorepo setup, dependencies, project structure
2. **Core Package** (3-4 days): Configuration, path calculation, templates, testing
3. **MCP Server** (2-3 days): Protocol integration, tool handlers, performance
4. **Integration** (1-2 days): Distribution setup, documentation, examples
5. **Validation** (1-2 days): End-to-end testing, edge cases, release prep

**Total Estimated Time: 8-13 days**

### Key Implementation Principles:
- **Fail Fast**: Clear error messages for configuration issues
- **Zero Latency**: All operations must be sub-10ms after config load
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Tool Agnostic**: No assumptions about agent's text search capabilities

### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: All core business logic (configuration, paths, templates)
- **Integration Tests**: MCP protocol compliance and tool functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Response time and memory usage validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Real AI assistant integration testing

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Configuration Validation**: Comprehensive YAML schema validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in timing and memory usage tracking
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear setup guide and troubleshooting section
